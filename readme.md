This game is inspired loosely by the old BBS door game called "Mutants!" and will look and feel similar in nature. There will be a couple of things that are similar to that game, and at least one that I feel most rpg style MMORPG games have slightly missed the boat on - the idea that sometimes, monsters chase you, anywhere you can go. In this game, the monsters will be driven by some custom code that will allow them to look, act, and seem like they are not NPC's at all, possibly even in chat messages. Aside from the web front end being of a hybrid gui/text based appearance, the only other main difference is that I fully plan to use a backend database instead of any kind of local saving or need for the player to save any data on the client side. This is 2023 after all, and text data is cheap to bounce wherever we want it to go. This will also be the first time I will attempt to create any kind of game with typescript. I've used it sparingly before for multiple tasks, but nothing quite as intricate as having possibly 10,000 monsters all roaming in a virtual world to potentially all move at the exact same time. This should be fun to watch me either succeed or fail. I do like to keep most of my code locally, and at least until the first of 2024 will continue to do so, but some things I will throw at github just to ease the way I transfer things from one computer to another, as I use multiple PC/laptop combinations depending on the day, or if it's raining.
